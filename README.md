<h3 align="left">Abstract of the study-case:</h3>
<p align="left">One of the regions of the brain by schizophrenia is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) which has been associated to the ability of task switching (TS). Nevertheless, literature suggests that people affected by schizophrenia (SCHZ) do not perform worse than neuro-typical ones in a task switching test: SCHZ are simply slower in TS, but reach the same performances of CTRL. This may suggest the existence of some unknown underlying compensation mechanism in the SCHZ’s brain.
The objective of our project: we wanted to the differences in brain activity between SCHZ and CTRL during TS,  considering the results of the 175 participants subjected to the following test.</p>

<h3 align="left">The experiment:</h3>
<p align="left">While their brain was scanned, each subject was presented with a series of geometric shapes and asked to identify either the color or the shape of the image shown. On 25% of trials the instructions switched, such that participants were instructed to switch from responding from shape to color, or vice versa.</p>

<h3 align="left">The aim:</h3>
<p align="left">Exploring neuronal activity/connectivity of the various subjects while they perform the task and evaluating possible differences between schizophrenic
and healthy subjects.</p>

<h3 align="left">Statistical tools:</h3>
<p align="left">An ANOVA of the subjects’ reaction times shows that both groups apply similar speed/accuracy tradeoffs. SCHZ performances are poorer than the CTRL ones, however, while the CTRL scores decrease when the subjects are requested to switch, SCHZ subjects’ performances are not affected by the switching.</p>

<p align="left">A PCA on the functional connectivity maps of the subjects yielded two results: <br>  
1)	SCHZ are more homogeneous in brain activity <br> 
2)	the distinction between SCHZ and CRTL is not given by a single region of the brain but by the interaction of multiple systems. 
Unfortunately, we cannot affirm that the PCA results are conclusive due to the high noise afflicting the data.</p>
